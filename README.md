Towards the end of my internship, I helped my supervisor clean and analyze roster and discipline data that we received from the MNPD. As my supervisor, Will Craft, puts it:

"This is an analysis of a cleaned file containing discipline incidents from the Metro Nashville Police Department. We joined officer race/gender from the official MNPD staff roster to the list of discipline incidents provided to reporter Samantha Max as a part of a series of public records requests.

APM Reports and WPLN requested more than a decade's worth of discipline data from the Metro Nashville Police Department. Reporters used a staff roster and a combination of manual cleaning and fuzzy string matching to join race and gender data of the officers to the discipline data. This allows us to understand the process of the opaque disciplinary process at the police department."

I was also tasked with fact checking his work, given that it's an important part of both data and journalism work. [Here](https://github.com/dv7jose/MNPD-Discipline-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Fact_Check_Will.ipynb) is my fact checking analysis of his work.

In all the analysis and fact-checking, I used pandas and altair to filter and categorize data to eventually make descriptive and exploratory findings.
